# Android Remote Encrypter (ARE)

![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/kevin-rabefaritra/remote-encrypter.svg)

Based on the research paper [RemoteEncrypter: An Android Database Asymmetric Encryption Module](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3325425.3329937).

### What is Android Remote Encrypter?
Android Remote Encrypter (ARE) is an Android application asymmetric encryption module on remote data read access. ARE constitutes an additional layer to the Android [ContentProvider][cp1].
Compared to existing databases encryption modules, ARE is:
1) More flexible: encryption can be applied to specific table columns
2) On-demand: encryption is applied when the ContentProvider query() method is being called
3) Lightweight: since the data is only encrypted through the ContentProvider, no decryption is needed for an internal database reading

### How does ARE work?
Assuming there are two applications A and B owned by different developers. Application B wants to access some data from application A's database. According to the Google Developers Guidelines, creating a content provider is suggested as the [following][cp2]: create a subclass of the ContentProvider class, override base query methods and declare the implementation in the Android Manifest. However, since it's not possible to restrict the access to pre-defined applications only the problem is malicious access by untrusted applications.
ARE works from a public-private generated keypair, data read through application A's ContentProvider are encrypted and decrypted by application B.

### Installation
**Add Jitpack to your project file:**
```javascript
allprojects {
    repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```
**Add the dependencies to your gradle file (app gradle):**
```javascript
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.kevin-rabefaritra:remote-encrypter:1.0.2'
}
```

### How to use
Assuming you have generated your public-private keypair:
1) In your custom ContentProvider class (used by the application hosting the database), invoke the encrypt method to the [Cursor][c1]:
```java
@Override
public Cursor query(@NonNull Uri uri, String[] projections, String selection, String[] selectionArgs, String sortOrder) {
    Cursor cursor = // Your implementation here ...
    return CursorServices.encrypt(cursor, PUBLIC_KEY, ENCRYPTED_COLUMNS, ALGORITHM);
}
```
where:
- **PUBLIC_KEY**:String is the base64 representation of the public key
- **ENCRYPTED_COLUMNS**:String[] are the columns to be encrypted
- **ALGORITHM**:String is the used encryption algorithm

2) From the application reading the database through the ContentProvider, since a [Cursor][c1] object is returned by the query(...) method, decrypting the data can be done as the following:
```java
...
    Cursor encryptedCursor = contentProvider.query(...);
    Cursor decryptedCursor = CursorServices.decrypt(encryptedCursor, PRIVATE_KEY, ENCRYPTED_COLUMNS, COLUMNS_TYPES, ALGORITHM);
    
    // Read data
    while(decryptedCursor.hasNext()) {
        ...
    }
    ...
```
where:
- **PRIVATE_KEY**:String is the base64 representation of the private key
- **ENCRYPTED_COLUMNS**:String[] are the columns to be decrypted
- **COLUMNS_TYPES**: int[] are the columns types (this will be changed to an array of Enum) since Integer values are changed to String before being encrypted.
- **EncryptServices.ALGORITHM**:String is the used encryption algorithm

# To do
- Add a string obfuscation technique in order to protect the private key from extraction
